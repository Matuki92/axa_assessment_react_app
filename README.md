# AXA assessment frontend app

I made this App as a technical test for AXA, the goal was to make a user-friendly and responsive app that browses through a huge list of gnomes living in a village and has to offer search and filter through the list. I considered it to be a fair challenge given that i didn't have any knowledge about Redux. I ended up being quite happy with the result and added a few extra details.

### STEPS

  - clone or download repo.
  ```sh
  $ git clone https://github.com/Matuki92/axa_assessment_react_app.git
  ```
  ```sh
  cd axa_assessment_react_app
  ```
  
  - install dependencies
  ```sh
  $ npm install
  ```
  
  - create build and run with node
  ```sh
  $ npm run build
  ```
  ```sh
  $ node app.js
  ```
  
  - access the app in
  ```sh
  localhost:8080
  ```
  
  ### APP INFO
  
I made this app as a technical test for AXA, it loads all the gnomes in a village and lets the user find them by either using some filters or picking a random one.
This is the first project I use Redux with, it was both challenging and fun and helped me learn a lot about this technology.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

  - [React] frontend library.
  - [Redux] for dynamic state management.
  - [Redux-thunk] middleware for async functions and actions
  - [Normalize.css] for css reset (just trying this one out)
