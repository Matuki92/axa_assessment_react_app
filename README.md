  ### APP INFO
  
I made this app as a technical test for AXA, it loads all the gnomes in a village and lets the user find them by either using some filters or picking a random one.
This is the first project I use Redux with, it was both challenging and fun and helped me learn a lot about this technology.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED

  - [React] frontend library.
  - [Redux] for dynamic state management.
  - [Redux-thunk] middleware for async functions and actions
  - [Normalize.css] for css reset (just trying this one out)
